formation = {
    "4-4-2": {
        "property": """The 4-4-2 is one of the ‘standard’ soccer formations.

This formation requires two centre midfielders who contribute on both ends of the pitch, creative wingers to generate goal scoring opportunities, and incredibly fit fullbacks.""",
        "strength": """Due to its simplicity, each player will have a good understanding of their roles and responsibilities when they’re out on the pitch.

The 4-4-2 is also a very balanced line-up, allowing teams to both attack and defend safely.

The presence of two centre-forwards in a 4-4-2 formation means both opposition centre-backs are constantly occupied when up against a back four.

The 4-4-2 provides a strong base from which to launch counter-attacks, with a good balance of players both in front of and behind the ball. There are usually enough players behind or around the ball to regain possession in the first place, and then also enough of a presence ahead of play to initiate and sustain a counter-attack, both in central and wide areas.

After dropping back into a block, the front two can block off access to central midfield, making it harder for opponents to build through the centre of pitch.

One final strength – which is significant for proponents of the 4-4-2 like Diego Simeone – is that sliding across the pitch in two units of four is easy to do while maintaining compactness.

The main strength of a midfield diamond is that it allows a team to have four players in central midfield. That will almost always mean a numerical overload against any other formation in a crucial part of the pitch.

The formation also allows you to play with two centre-forwards, who can always occupy both centre-backs in a back four. If you are up against a back three and the opposition has a one-player advantage in that part of the pitch, they are very unlikely to match up numerically in central midfield.

The four-player midfield unit provides a staggered defensive shape that makes it easier to defend spaces between the lines, and gives numbers in central areas. The front two, meanwhile, can either block off central access, or press the outside shoulders of the opposition centre-backs. This cuts off the full-backs and forces play into central midfield, where there are lots of defenders.

When defending for prolonged periods, a mobile midfield diamond can lock play near a touchline better than most other formations.
""",
        "weakness": """Teams playing in a 4-4-2 can sometimes suffer from a lack of passing options.

With only two central midfielders (who are expected to contribute a lot), they can quickly be overwhelmed by a team who plays with three in the centre of the park.

The 4-4-2 requires lots of hard work, runs and movement from the players, because the basic structure is not the most conducive to playing a passing game. Players in a rigid 4-4-2 structure can block teammates from passing to one another, particularly when playing forwards. For example, a central defender, central midfielder and centre-forward would all be on the same passing line. Without the required movements, this formation can become more predictable than others.

With two flat lines of four and no depth to midfield, spaces between the lines can be difficult to cover. One penetrative pass can therefore cut several players out of the game quickly. A central-midfield two will also often face a numerical overload, as plenty of opponents will set up with a midfield three.

Unless the full-backs push forward when the team is in possession, there will be an obvious and distinct lack of width in attack.

Out of possession, the wide areas can also give the opposition a target to counter-attack into. Quick, accurate switches of play over the central midfield unit can leave the full-backs underloaded. This means the nearest central midfielder has to get across quickly. They may have to make lateral runs constantly when out of possession, leaving them fatigued when play is turned over and they are needed in attack.

    "4-2-3-1": {
        "property": """Perfect for teams looking to attack while retaining their solidity at the back.

With four at the back and two central midfielders lying in front of the defence, the four attacking players have freedom to express themselves and attack the opposition.""",
        "strength": """It can be a nightmare to defend against a team with such flexibility in attack.

By interchanging positions, space can open up in front of the opposition's defence and create goal scoring chances for the striker to tuck away.

Despite all the attacking potential, the team retains its solid spine as the defenders are protected by the central midfielders.

With the number 10 able to drop into midfield when the team in possession, a team playing in a 4-2-3-1 can create numerical overloads in central midfield when up against a midfield two. This helps in build-up play, chance creation, playing through the thirds and in any attempts to dominate possession. The number 10 can play a little higher than a central midfielder might in a 4-3-3. From that position, they can link the midfield and the attack. They are also able to find central spaces between the lines and away from pressure.

The support and security provided by a double pivot allows the full-backs to push forward more effectively. They will often do so at the same, which may not be the case from a 4-3-3 formation. The defensive midfielders in a double pivot also protect the spaces between the lines and ahead of the centre-backs. They are able to move across to cover the wide areas more quickly and more effectively than a single pivot would be able to. This means they can get across following a switch of play, or cover the spaces an advanced full-back leaves vacant.
""",
        "weakness": """The team risks being exposed out wide if the wingers don’t track back and support their fullback.

The 4-2-3-1 formation relies on superb discipline and organisation. Even more so than other formations, everyone must work together as a unit both offensively and defensively.

The use of a double pivot inevitably means one fewer attacking player. That can result in too little central attacking presence once the ball has been moved forwards.

The three central midfielders can be numerically overloaded against four central players, such as in a 4-4-2 diamond. If the number 10 does not drop in when out of possession, the double pivot can be overloaded by a midfield three.

Meanwhile, the wide areas can be left exposed to opposition counter-attacks. Accurate switches of play can leave the central midfield unit with too much ground to cover to get across.

With the right players, the 4-3-3 allows you to control the midfield while offering up an attacking outlook right from the start of the match.

This is a relatively attacking formation employing three players in more advanced roles. The 4-3-3 formation often involves using two wingers and a striker in the forward positions. Not many teams use this formation from the start of a game, although they may often switch to it if they are losing and in desperate need of a goal!
""",

This will help you to control possession as there will be a lot of passing options if your team is committed to good movement and spacing.

Up front, three forwards means your team will always be a threat to score.

The main strength of a 4-3-3 is the presence of a third player in central midfield, which creates a numerical overload when up against a team playing with two. This helps in build-up, playing through the lines, creating chances and overall domination of possession. The basic shape of a 4-3-3 tends to create more triangles between players, and so more passing lanes are open to the ball-carrier. This, in theory at least, makes it easier to play a possession-based game – and this is one reason Johan Cruyff preferred such a shape for the positional game he liked his teams to play. Zinedine Zidane's Real Madrid had plenty of success in a 4-3-3, too.

In attack, wide wingers flanking a single centre-forward can be enough to pin four defenders back. This creates an overload elsewhere on the pitch and should, in theory, make it easier to progress up the pitch.

Defensively, the 4-3-3 provides numbers and compactness in central areas. A staggered midfield shape – often a single pivot behind two number eights – makes it easier to defend the space between the defensive and midfield lines. It is easier to press high up the pitch, meanwhile, with three players in the front line rather than two.

""",
        "weakness": """If the centre midfielders aren’t disciplined, there’s a risk the formation can get dragged out of shape which will open up space for the opposition to exploit - especially on the wings.

The team’s forwards need to be incredibly fit and help out at the back for the 4-3-3 to work.

The main weakness of a 4-3-3 is that the single centre-forward can be left isolated, and is naturally underloaded whether playing against two or three centre-backs. This means you need a player in this position who is willing to do lots of work that may bring little or no reward. They also need to be strong and good enough on the ball to hold off several defenders.

The three central midfielders can end up numerically overloaded against four central players – for example, in a 4-4-2 diamond. The central midfielders can also end up with a lot of ground to cover. If they don’t get across the pitch following a switch of play, the full-backs can be left exposed and isolated with no wide midfielder ahead of them, and the winger usually high up the pitch. Opponents can also target wide areas on the counter-attack, particularly if a full-back has pushed up.

        "strength": """The 3-5-2 formation will allow you to dominate possession and maximise your attacking output.

With five players across the midfield, you can pin the opposition into their own half, preventing them from playing from the back and forcing them into mistakes.

Defensively, with three at the back and a number of midfielders ready to help out, the team can easily revert back to a 5-3-2.

The midfield unit of five in a 3-5-2 formation provides both width to build around the opposition and numbers in central midfield to play through them, without the need for much in the way of movement or rotations. The three central midfielders can draw opponents into the middle of the pitch, before play is then spread wide to the wing-backs. They can then provide width on both sides at the same time.

Two centre-forwards can constantly occupy both opposing centre-backs in a back four. High wing-backs and one or two attacking midfielders can mean extra numbers in the final third, and a strong attacking threat.

In defence, three centre-backs provide numerical overloads against two centre-forwards. The back line can also quickly change from three to a five when the wing-backs drop. In possession, the three-player defence gives a strong foundation to build from. It doesn’t require any adjustments to have an overload in the first line, whether up against one or two centre-forwards.

The midfield three and front two can cover the central spaces well when out of possession, with lots of depth to plug gaps.

The centre midfielders all need to be comfortable on the ball. If they don’t communicate clearly, they risk getting in each other’s way ruining the formation’s spacing.

Once the defence converts into a line of five, the wide areas in midfield are inevitably conceded. This allows the opposition to progress further up the pitch on the flanks.

The wing-backs are required to be more versatile and well-rounded players than either full-back or wingers in back-four systems, as they are needed almost constantly at both ends of the pitch. They also need to be extremely fit to cover a vast amount of ground.

The presence of two number 10s adds another threat between the lines, which can occupy both players in a double pivot or drag a centre-back out if up against a single pivot.

A wider front three can also pin a back four, which creates an overload elsewhere on the pitch. A wider front line can also create overloads along with an advancing wing-back.

Out of possession, the back line can quickly change from a three to a five via the wing-backs withdrawing, adding extra presence in the back line. A narrow front three can block central access even more effectively than a pair of centre-forwards. They can also initiate a high press effectively.

    "4-4-2": "## property\nThe 4-4-2 soccer formation is a traditional setup that relies on versatile centre midfielders, creative wingers, and highly fit fullbacks to function effectively.\n\n## strength\nThe 4-4-2 formation is praised for its simplicity, balance, and effectiveness in both attack and defense. It ensures clear roles for players, occupies opposition center-backs with two forwards, and facilitates strong counter-attacks with a balanced distribution of players. The formation also allows for effective pressing and compact sliding across the pitch, making it difficult for opponents to build through the center. Additionally, the midfield diamond variant of the formation provides a numerical advantage in central midfield, a staggered defensive shape for better space coverage, and strategic pressing options. This setup is particularly effective in controlling central areas and can adapt well to defending against different opposition setups.\n\n## weakness\nTeams employing a 4-4-2 formation may struggle with limited passing options due to only having two central midfielders, making them prone to being overwhelmed by opponents with a three-player midfield. The rigid structure of 4-4-2 can hinder fluid passing and movement, making the team's play predictable. This formation also struggles with covering spaces between lines and can suffer from a lack of width in attack unless full-backs advance. Additionally, the 4-4-2 setup can be vulnerable to counter-attacks in wide areas, putting extra pressure on midfielders and potentially leading to fatigue.\n\n",

This flexibility, often seen in a 4-2-3-1 formation, allows for a solid defensive structure backed by central midfielders, while enabling the number 10 to drop into midfield to create numerical advantages and link play between midfield and attack. The formation also supports full-backs pushing forward, with a double pivot of defensive midfielders providing cover for the defense and compensating for the spaces left by advancing players. This approach facilitates build-up play, chance creation, and possession dominance, while maintaining a strong defensive core.\n\n## weakness\nThe 4-2-3-1 formation demands high discipline and teamwork, with risks including exposure on the wings if wingers don't support their fullbacks, a potential lack of central attacking presence due to the double pivot, and vulnerability to being outnumbered in midfield, especially against a 4-4-2 diamond.

This setup, with three forwards, poses a constant offensive threat and facilitates a possession-based game by creating numerous passing lanes through triangular player arrangements. Historically favored by coaches like Johan Cruyff for its positional play, the formation also allows for defensive solidity with a compact midfield and the ability to press high with three attackers. Overall, the 4-3-3 is effective for dominating possession, creating scoring opportunities, and maintaining defensive organization.\n\n## weakness\nThe 4-3-3 formation requires disciplined central midfielders to maintain shape and prevent the opposition from exploiting space, especially on the wings. Forwards must be fit and contribute defensively. A key vulnerability is the potential isolation of the single centre-forward, who must be strong and skilled to handle multiple defenders.

Offensively, it enables wide play through wing-backs and concentrated attacks through the center, with two forwards pressuring the opposition's defense. Defensively, it offers numerical advantages against attacks and a solid base for building play from the back. This formation balances attacking threat with defensive stability, making it effective in both phases of the game.\n\n## weakness\nThe effectiveness of the 3-5-2 formation heavily relies on the capabilities of the wingbacks, who play a crucial role in both attack and defense. Central midfielders must be adept and communicative to maintain the formation's integrity. The shift to a five-man defense can concede midfield width, allowing opponents to advance on the flanks. Wingbacks in this formation must be versatile, fit, and capable of covering extensive ground.
